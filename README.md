# OC-DTDD
This repository contains code which implements a similar scheme to Optimal Centralised Dynamic-Time-Division-Duplex in MATLAB. There are 2 files. One which computes the values and another which iterates the first file to obtain average value over many iterations and produce data for plotting.
The code is definitely not optimised for memory but I will clean it up some time in the future. Currently SI suppression is not properly implemented and noise is too large.
There are lots of improvements left to be made.
